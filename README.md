##Analysis of goal amount and campaign outcomes

-Kickstarter seems most effective When raising <5K campaigns(70% of campaigns were successful) which aligns with Fever
-There are certain ranges where it seems like more campaigns fail than succeed (if raising between 25K-35K and then again raising over 45K)
-Considering that the percentage of canceled campaigns also increases with campaign goal amounts it is possible that other more effective vehicles to raise money become available at those amounts

##Analysis of launch date and campaign outcomes

-It doesn't seem like there's any relationship between date of campaign launch and outcome because successful and failed outcomes seem to have similar fluctuations with launch months
-However there are generally more campaigns in the summer months so launching on the off months could reduce the competition for campaigns
